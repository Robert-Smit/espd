The {homepage} service is a web-based solution which allows the http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm[Member States] and http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies[European Institutions] to exchange structured
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-procurement[e-procurement] information in a harmonised manner. The system is not a persistent storage but rather a transformation
service which enables the management of XML based documents for each procurement submitted.

The {homepage} service is provided as a web-based system and the output of it provided as XML files. In addition,
the {homepage} service will become part of the https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/connecting-europe-facility[Connecting European Facility (CEF)] https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eProcurement[eProcurement DSI (Digital Service
Infrastructure)]. The CEF will help the Member States to implement an {homepage} service in their own country and
provide additional services to their users.
