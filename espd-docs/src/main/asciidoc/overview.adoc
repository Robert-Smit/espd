== Overview

The {espd} application is composed of two {maven} modules:

* *espd-docs* contains the documentation of the application
* *espd-web* holds the deployable web part of the application

The Java library `eu.europa.ec.grow.espd.exchange-model` contains the {jaxb} classes of the {espd-edm}.

The ESPD web application is quite simple in nature and can be deployed as an executable WAR file (with an embedded Tomcat
server) or as a normal WAR file on a Servlet 3 container like Tomcat or Jetty or an application server like Weblogic.

The main responsibilities of the application are handled as follows:

* Infrastructural support at the application level and dependency injection via the {spring} framework
* Configuration of the application via {springBoot}
* Logging with the {slf4j} API and {logback} as implementation
* The view part uses {springMvc}, JSP files, {tiles}, Javascript, {jquery} and {bootstrap}
* The XML model uses {jaxb} to marshal/unmarshal the ESPD generated XML files
* REST calls to external services are handled with the https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/[Spring Rest Template] client
* Monitoring and analytics via {javaMelody} and {piwik}
* Optimization of static resources with https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/24/spring-framework-4-1-handling-static-web-resources[Spring asset pipeline] and {wro4j}

=== Java packages overview

The main Java package of the web application is 'eu.europa.ec.grow.espd` found in the `espd-web` module. It is further
subdivided into the following important packages:

* config
* controller
* domain
* ted
* util
* xml

==== Config package

The `config` package contains the Java classes which are supposed to provide the configuration for the global project
`EspdApplication`, {springMvc} web configuration `WebConfiguration`, the {jaxb} configuration etc. You will
notice that these classes are annotated with `@Configuration` and they generally define {spring} beans that can be
injected in other {spring} managed classes of the application.

==== Controller package

The `controller` package consists of the {springMvc} controllers which are responsible for processing user requests,
building an appropriate model and passing it to the view for rendering or which can act as {rest} controllers.

The most important one is `EspdController` and its responsibilities include dealing with the generation of the {espd}
requests and responses, uploading files, printing and error handling. The main flow of the application is handled by
this class.

Other controllers which are present in this package are the `AboutController` that is used to populate the `/about`
page of the application and `MessageSourceController` which is responsible for loading the i18n messages needed
by the client-side i18n engine.

==== Domain package

The `domain` package contains the pieces involved in the representation of an ESPD request or response in the model
(the `M` part of the MVC architectural pattern) of the web application. An ESPD request/response is represented
internally as an `EspdDocument` which in turn contains fields for all the possible criteria, authority and economic
operator information or procurement procedure data.

In the `domain.enums` sub-package you can find the enumerations holding the criteria, requirement groups, requirements,
countries, languages, currencies etc which are used by the application. The criteria definitions load metadata coming
from some JSON configuration files under `src/main/resources/criteria` and store the information dynamically in the
criterion enumerations.

==== TED package

The `ted` package is responsible for the interaction with the TED {rest} service which provides the procurement
procedure information for an {espd} request or response.

==== Util package

The `util` package contains various utility classes, for example, some of the application properties that are needed
by the user interface are loaded by {spring} in the `EspdConfiguration` class. The `I18NFunc` class loads the i18n
messages needed by the client-side internationalization engine.

==== XML package

The `xml` package takes care of the marshalling/unmarshalling of the ESPD request and response XML files. It is further
divided into a package for `request`, one for `response` and a `common` package with shared functionality between the
other two. The classes from this package make use of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern[Template method design pattern] to share common
behaviour and design.

The `request` and `response` packages contain each an `exporting` and an `importing` sub-package. The `exporting` package
is responsible for generating the ESPD request/response XML files while the `importing` package knows how to parse XML
files representing ESPD request or response and convert them into the internal ESPD domain objects.

The `EspdExchangeMarshaller` is the main class that aggregates all of the classes from this package together and is
injected in the `EspdController` to perform the marshalling/unmarshalling logic.

`CriteriaTemplates` serves as configuration for the user interface components of the criteria and requirements that
are defined in the JSP and {tiles} files.

=== Web overview

The web packages can be found in the standard Maven location, i.e. `src/main/webapp`. The `static` folder contains the
CSS and Javascript files referenced by the web application. The JSP files are located in the `WEB-INF/views` folder where
they are subsequently grouped in sub-folders. The `src/main/resources` folder contains the configuration files relating
to internationalization, logging, web resource optimizations and general application properties.
